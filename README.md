# SERVICE ORIENTED ARCHITECTURE

## WHAT IS SERVICE ORIENTED ARCHITECTURE

Service Oriented Architecture, or SOA, is a style of software design where services are provided to the other components by application components, through a communication protocol over a network. Its principles are independent of vendors and other technologies. In service oriented architecture, a number of services communicate with each other, in one of two ways: through passing data or through two or more services coordinating some activity[^1].

SOA defines a way to make software components reusable via service interfaces. These interfaces utilize common communication standards in such a way that they can be rapidly incorporated into new applications without having to perform deep integration each time[^2].

## HISTORY OF SOA

SOA represents an important stage in the evolution of application development and integration over the last few decades. Before SOA emerged in the late 1990s, connecting an application to data or functionality housed in another system required complex point-to-point integrationâ€”integration that developers had to recreate, in part or whole, for each new development project. Exposing those functions through SOA eliminates the need to recreate the deep integration every time[^2].
